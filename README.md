#### By _**J. Michael Brown**_

## Description

_Contains a class that allows the user to perform several methods to check two words for to see if they qualify as Anagrams, Antigrams (words share no letters), and a method to check for overlapping letters. Also comes with a paired method that utilizes this new class to perform these functionalities on a whole sentence/phrase._

_Word?() test to check if a given input is a word currently checks for: vowels, ._
